  "Rationale": {
    "C1_All_Runnable": "All 26 code blocks from demo.ipynb and attribute_lens.ipynb executed successfully without errors. Model loading used optimized settings (float16, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, device_map='auto'). LRE cache files were properly extracted and loaded.",
    "C2_All_Correct": "All implementations correctly follow the described computation in the plan/codewalk. LRE approximation (W*s + b) is correctly applied, Jacobian ICL Mean Estimator computes the correct mean Jacobian, and both faithfulness and causality metrics are computed as specified.",
    "C3_No_Redundant": "No duplicate or redundant code blocks were found. Each block serves a distinct purpose in the LRE demonstration pipeline.",
    "C4_No_Irrelevant": "All code blocks contribute directly to the project goal of demonstrating Linear Relational Embeddings for relation decoding. The demo notebooks cover LRE estimation, faithfulness evaluation, causality evaluation, and attribute lens application."
