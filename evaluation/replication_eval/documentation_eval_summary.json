    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "PASS",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "Replicated results match original findings within acceptable tolerance. Average faithfulness (47.1%) aligns with the reported ~48%. Causality (72%) exceeds faithfulness as expected. High-performing relations (country capital city at 94.7%) and low-performing relations (person plays instrument at 5%) demonstrate the same patterns described in the original paper about linearly vs non-linearly decodable relations.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "All replicated conclusions are consistent with the original. The documentation correctly states that: (1) LRE works for a subset of relations, (2) causality evaluation confirms causal structure, and (3) patterns are model-independent. No contradictions or significant omissions identified.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "All information in the replicated documentation traces to legitimate original sources: paper reference from CodeWalkthrough.md, methodology from plan.md, dataset details from plan.md, hyperparameters from demo notebooks, and numerical results from actual execution outputs. No external references, invented findings, or hallucinated details were introduced."
