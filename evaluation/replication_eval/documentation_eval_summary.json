  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "The replicated documentation reports results consistent with the original: 55% average faithfulness aligns with the original's ~48% of relations achieving >60% faithfulness. Country-related factual relations show high faithfulness (70-90%), while linguistic relations show lower faithfulness (20-40%), matching the original paper's findings. The replication correctly identifies that not all relations are linearly decodable.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "The replicated documentation presents all four core conclusions from the original paper: (1) linear approximation works for a subset of relations, (2) LRE can be estimated from Jacobian on ICL examples, (3) inverse LRE enables representation editing, and (4) not all relations are linearly decodable. The conclusions accurately reflect the original paper's findings without contradiction or omission.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "The replicated documentation does not introduce external or hallucinated information. The methodology (LRE, Jacobian estimation, faithfulness/causality metrics) accurately reflects the original paper. Minor differences in hyperparameters (n=5 vs n=8, beta=2.5 vs 2.25) represent legitimate experimental variations, not hallucinated claims. Environment details (GPT-J-6B, A100 GPU) describe the actual replication setup. All conclusions derive from the original paper's findings."
