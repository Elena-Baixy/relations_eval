Linear relation representations may be obtained by constructing a first-order approximation to the LM from a single prompt, and they exist for a variety of factual, commonsense, and linguistic relations. However, we also identify many cases in which LM predictions capture relational knowledge accurately, but this knowledge is not linearly encoded in their representations.

      "Replicate the experiments from the paper \"Linearity of Relation Decoding in Transformer LMs\" (Hernandez et al., 2023). The paper investigates how transformer language models represent and decode relational knowledge, specifically testing whether relation decoding can be well-approximated by linear transformations on subject representations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Data\n",
      "\n",
      "The dataset contains 47 relations across four categories:\n",
      "- **Factual**: country-capital, country-language, person-occupation, etc.\n",
      "- **Commonsense**: work-location, substance-phase, fruit-color, etc.\n",
      "- **Linguistic**: adjective-antonym, adjective-comparative, verb-past-tense, etc.\n",

      "## Method\n",
      "\n",
      "### Linear Relational Embedding (LRE)\n",
      "\n",
      "The core hypothesis is that for many relations, the transformer's decoding procedure can be approximated by a linear transformation:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "LRE(s) = W * s + b\n",

      "- `s` is the subject representation at intermediate layer h\n",
      "- `W` is the Jacobian matrix (∂z/∂s)\n",
      "- `b` is the bias term (z - W*s)\n",
      "- `z` is the object representation at the final layer\n",
      "\n",
      "### Jacobian Estimation\n",
      "\n",
      "For each relation, we compute the LRE by:\n",
      "1. Using n=5 in-context learning examples\n",
      "2. Computing the Jacobian at layer 5 for each example\n",
      "3. Averaging the Jacobians and biases across examples\n",
      "4. Scaling by beta=2.5 to correct for underestimation\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Faithfulness**: Measures whether LRE predictions match the full model predictions\n",
      "   - `argmax D(LRE(s)) == argmax D(F(s,c))`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Causality**: Measures whether editing subject representations changes predictions\n",
      "   - Using inverse LRE: `Δs = W† @ (z' - z)`\n",
      "   - Check if edited prediction matches target object\n",

      "\n",
      "The replication successfully demonstrates the core claims of the original paper:\n",

      "1. For a subset of relations, the highly non-linear decoding procedure can be approximated by a simple linear transformation\n",
