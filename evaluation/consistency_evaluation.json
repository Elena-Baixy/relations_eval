    },
    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All evaluable conclusions in the documentation match the results originally recorded in the code implementation notebooks. Specifically: (1) The 48% of relations achieving >60% faithfulness claim is stated in both plan.md and documentation.pdf (Section 1, Figure 3). (2) The Company CEO relation showing <6% faithfulness is explicitly mentioned in Section 4.1 of the documentation. (3) The R=0.84 correlation between faithfulness and causality is confirmed in Figure 6. (4) LRE outperforming baselines (Identity, Translation, Linear Regression) is verified in Figure 4. (5) The attribute lens recovering 54-63% R@1 on distracted prompts matches Table 3 exactly. (6) Cross-model correlations (GPT-J vs GPT-2-XL: R=0.85; GPT-J vs LLaMA-13B: R=0.71) are confirmed in Appendix H. The notebooks (faithfulness.ipynb, causality.ipynb, demo.ipynb) contain consistent experimental outputs.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "All plan steps appear in the implementation. The plan specifies: (1) Extract LREs using mean Jacobian from n=8 examples - implemented in src/operators.py (JacobianIclMeanEstimator class). (2) Evaluate faithfulness by comparing LRE predictions to transformer predictions - implemented in src/metrics.py and notebooks/figures/faithfulness.ipynb. (3) Evaluate causality using inverse LRE for editing - implemented in src/editors.py (LowRankPInvEditor class). (4) Test on GPT-J, GPT-2-XL, and LLaMA-13B - all models supported in src/models.py with hyperparameters in hparams/gptj/, hparams/gpt2-xl/, hparams/llama/. (5) Dataset of 47 relations across factual (26), commonsense (8), linguistic (6), and bias (7) categories - verified in data/ directory with exactly 47 relation files. (6) Attribute Lens application - implemented in src/attributelens/. All key implementation files exist and the codebase structure matches the methodology described in the plan."
