    },
    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "All evaluable conclusions in the documentation match the results originally recorded in the implementation notebooks. The plan claims about faithfulness (48% of relations >60% on GPT-J), causality (exceeds faithfulness), cross-model correlations (R=0.85 for GPT-J vs GPT-2-XL, R=0.71 for GPT-J vs LLaMA-13B), and baseline comparisons are all consistent with the recorded results in notebooks/figures/faithfulness.ipynb, notebooks/figures/causality.ipynb, and demo/demo.ipynb. The category-wise faithfulness results show 64-91% average across categories, causality results show 72-98% across categories, and both metrics show consistent patterns across models.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "All plan steps appear in the implementation. (1) LRE extraction via JacobianIclMeanEstimator in src/operators.py implements mean Jacobian W and bias b computation. (2) Faithfulness evaluation via faithfulness() in src/benchmarks.py. (3) Causality evaluation via causality() in src/benchmarks.py and LowRankPInvEditor in src/editors.py. (4) Multi-model support for GPT-J, GPT-2-XL, LLaMA-13B in src/models.py. (5) Dataset contains 47 relations across 4 categories (26 factual, 8 commonsense, 6 linguistic, 7 bias). (6) All 6 experiments have implementations and corresponding notebooks."
