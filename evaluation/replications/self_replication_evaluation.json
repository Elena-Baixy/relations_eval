    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "PASS",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "PASS",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "PASS",
    "RP4_DemoPresentation": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "The experiment can be fully reconstructed from plan.md and CodeWalkthrough.md. The plan clearly describes the hypothesis (LRE approximation), methodology (Jacobian-based estimation), and evaluation metrics (faithfulness and causality). Demo notebooks provide complete working examples. No major guesswork required.",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "Environment successfully restored: requirements.txt lists all dependencies, baukit installs from GitHub, all imports work correctly, GPT-2-XL loads from HuggingFace, no version conflicts encountered. Python 3.10+ requirement is met.",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "Seeds properly set using set_seed(12345) as demonstrated in demo notebooks. Results are stable across runs. The repository explicitly handles random seed setting through experiment_utils.set_seed(). Replicated results match between script and notebook execution.",
    "RP4_DemoPresentation": "Repository provides comprehensive demos: demo/demo.ipynb demonstrates complete LRE workflow including faithfulness and causality evaluation; demo/attribute_lens.ipynb demonstrates Attribute Lens application. Demos executable without external materials, all inputs and configurations specified, outputs match expected behavior."
