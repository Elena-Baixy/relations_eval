  "Checklist": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "PASS",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "PASS",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "The experiment was successfully reconstructed from plan.md and CodeWalkthrough.md. The methodology (Jacobian computation, ICL examples, beta scaling) and evaluation metrics (faithfulness, causality) were clearly documented. Minor interpretation was needed for token indexing and layer selection, but these were well-documented.",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "The environment was reproducible with requirements.txt and pyproject.toml. GPT-J-6B was available in local cache. Minor workarounds were needed for torchvision/torch version mismatch and SVD CUDA issues, but these did not prevent faithful replication.",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "Results were stable and deterministic. Random seed 12345 was used consistently. Jacobian computation and model inference produced consistent predictions. Faithfulness scores showed expected variation across relation types (20-90%), with the overall pattern being stable across runs."
